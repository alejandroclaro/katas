Code katas in C++ 11/14

Dependencies
------------

* Unit test framework: Google Test 1.7.0

Explanation
-----------

In this kata exercise I try to use C++11/14 features and idioms not present in C++98. So, maybe there is a simple solution in some cases but find just the simplest solution was not my intention. I want to exercise C++11 features and compare these against other languages (including C and C++98).
