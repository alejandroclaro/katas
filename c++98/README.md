Code katas in C++ 98/03

Dependencies
------------

* Unit test framework: Google Test 1.7.0

Explenation
-----------

In this kata exercise I try to use C++ features and idioms not present in C. So, maybe there is a simple solution in some cases but find just the simplest solution was not my intention. I want to exercise C++98 idioms and features and compare these against other languages (including C and C++11).
